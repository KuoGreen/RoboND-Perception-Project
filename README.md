# The Perception Pipeline

Following sections will explain the different stages of the percption pipeline used to detect objects before starting the pick and place robot movement.


## Select topic and convert ROS msg to PCL data

The first step in the perception pipeline is to subscribe to the the camera data (point cloud) topic `/pr2/world/points` from which we will get a point cloud with noise as seen below:

before we can process the data we need to convert it from **ROS PointCloud2** message to a **PCL PointXYZRGB** format using the following code:

```python
cloud_filtered = ros_to_pcl(ros_pcl_msg)
```

## Statistical Outlier Filtering

First filter is the  **PCLâ€™s Statistical Outlier Removal** filter. in this filter for each point in the point cloud, it computes the distance to all of its neighbors, and then calculates a mean distance. By assuming a Gaussian distribution, all points whose mean distances are outside of an interval defined by the global distances mean+standard deviation are considered to be outliers and removed from the point cloud.

Code is as following:

```python
    # Create a statistical filter object: 
    outlier_filter = cloud_filtered.make_statistical_outlier_filter()
    # Set the number of neighboring points to analyze for any given point
    outlier_filter.set_mean_k(3)
    # Set threshold scale factor
    x = 0.00001
    # Any point with a mean distance larger than global (mean distance+x*std_dev)
    # will be considered outlier
    outlier_filter.set_std_dev_mul_thresh(x)
    # Call the filter function
    cloud_filtered = outlier_filter.filter()
```
Mean K = 3 was the best value I found to almost remove all noise pixels. any value higher than 3 was leaving some of the noise pixels behind. x was selcted to be 0.00001.

following image is showing result after removal of noise:

## Voxel Grid Downsampling

2nd stage is **Voxel Grid Downsampling** filter to derive a point cloud that has fewer points but should still do a good job of representing the input point cloud as a whole. This is done to reduce required computation power without impacting the final results. Code is as following:

```python
    # Create a VoxelGrid filter object for our input point cloud
    vox = cloud_filtered.make_voxel_grid_filter()
    # Choose a voxel (also known as leaf) size
    # 1 means 1mx1mx1m leaf size   
    LEAF_SIZE = 0.005  
    # Set the voxel (or leaf) size  
    vox.set_leaf_size(LEAF_SIZE, LEAF_SIZE, LEAF_SIZE)
    # Call the filter function to obtain the resultant downsampled point cloud
    cloud_filtered = vox.filter()
```
After trying diffrent sizes I have selected leaf size 0.005 to avoid any impact on point cloud details.

result is as shown in below image:

## Create Cluster-Mask Point Cloud to visualize each cluster separately

## Converts a pcl PointXYZRGB to a ROS PointCloud2 message
```python
    ros_cloud_objects = pcl_to_ros(extracted_objects)
    ros_cloud_table   = pcl_to_ros(extracted_table)
    ros_cluster_cloud = pcl_to_ros(cluster_cloud)
```

## Publish ROS messages
```python
    pcl_objects_pub.publish(ros_cloud_objects)
    pcl_table_pub.publish(ros_cloud_table)
    pcl_cluster_pub.publish(ros_cluster_cloud)
```

### Issues faced during project

* When compliling using `catkin_make` I used to get error "cannot convert to bool". I resolved it by adding `static_cast<bool>()`. [see this ](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/14801/catkin-make-unable-to-build-and-throws-makefile138-recipe-for-target-all-fa)

### Future improvements
